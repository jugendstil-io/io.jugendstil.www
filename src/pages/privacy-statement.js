            in order to provide you with the best possible service and
            experience when using our Website. Specifically, Data may be used by

            We may use your Data for the above purposes if we deem it necessary
            to do so for our legitimate interests. If you are not satisfied with
            this, you have the right to object in certain circumstances (see the
            section headed "Your rights" below).
          </p>
          p>
          <p>
            For the delivery of direct marketing to you via e-mail, we'll need
            your consent, whether via an opt-in or soft-opt-in:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              soft opt-in consent is a specific type of consent which applies
              when you have previously engaged with us (for example, you contact
              us to ask us for more details about a particular product/service,
              and we are marketing similar products/services). Under "soft
              opt-in" consent, we will take your consent as given unless you
              opt-out.
            </li>
            <li>
              for other types of e-marketing, we are required to obtain your
              explicit consent; that is, you need to take positive and
              affirmative action when consenting by, for example, checking a
              tick box that we'll provide.
            </li>
            <li>
              if you are not satisfied about our approach to marketing, you have
              the right to withdraw consent at any time. To find out how to
              withdraw your consent, see the section headed "Your rights" below.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            When you register with us and set up an account to receive our
            services, the legal basis for this processing is the performance of
            a contract between you and us and/or taking steps, at your request,
            to enter into such a contract.
          </p>

          <p>
            We will use technical and organisational measures to safeguard your
            Data, for example:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              access to your account is controlled by a password and a user name
              that is unique to you.
            </li>
            <li>we store your Data on secure servers.</li>
            <li>
              payment details are encrypted using SSL technology (typically you
              will see a lock icon or green address bar (or both) in your
              browser when we use this technology.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Technical and organisational measures include measures to deal with
            any suspected data breach. If you suspect any misuse or loss or
            unauthorised access to your Data, please let us know immediately by
            contacting us via this e-mail address: privacy@jugendstil.io.

              access to the information we hold about you, we will not charge
              you for this, unless your request is "manifestly unfounded or
              excessive." Where we are legally permitted to do so, we may refuse
              your request. If we refuse your request, we will tell you the
              reasons why.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Right to correct</strong> - the right to have your Data

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Right to data portability</strong> - the right to request
              that we move, copy or transfer your Data.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Right to object</strong>- the right to object to our use
              of your Data including where we use it for our legitimate
              interests.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            To make enquiries, exercise any of your rights set out above, or
            withdraw your consent to the processing of your Data (where consent
            is our legal basis for processing your Data), please contact us via
            this e-mail address: privacy@jugendstil.io.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are not satisfied with the way a complaint you make in
            relation to your Data is handled by us, you may be able to refer
            your complaint to the relevant data protection authority. For the
            UK, this is the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). The ICO's
            contact details can be found on their website at
            https://ico.org.uk/.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is important that the Data we hold about you is accurate and
            current. Please keep us informed if your Data changes during the
            period for which we hold it.
          </p>
          <h2>Transfers outside the European Economic Area</h2>
          <p>
            Data which we collect from you may be stored and processed in and
            transferred to countries outside of the European Economic Area
            (EEA). For example, this could occur if our servers are located in a
            country outside the EEA or one of our service providers is situated
            in a country outside the EEA. We also share information with our
            group companies, some of which are located outside the EEA.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will only transfer Data outside the EEA where it is compliant
            with data protection legislation and the means of transfer provides
            adequate safeguards in relation to your data, eg by way of data
            transfer agreement, incorporating the current standard contractual
            clauses adopted by the European Commission, or by signing up to the
            EU-US Privacy Shield Framework, in the event that the organisation
            in receipt of the Data is based in the United States of America.
