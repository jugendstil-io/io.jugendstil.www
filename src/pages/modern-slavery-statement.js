            We are committed to improving our practices to combat slavery and
            human trafficking. We recognize that slavery and human trafficking
            is a real yet hidden issue in our society. We will not tolerate
            slavery and human trafficking in our business or supply chain.
            Accordingly, we have taken the following steps to ensure that no
            such practice exists within our business or supply chain.
