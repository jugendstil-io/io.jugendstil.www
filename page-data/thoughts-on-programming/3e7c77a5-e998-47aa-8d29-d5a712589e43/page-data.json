What does it take for a machine to pass the Turing test and convince a human operator it is one of their kind? The test itself is very rudimentary; however, it remains the baseline that needs to be reached before a machine can be considered intelligent."],"id":"3e7c77a5-e998-47aa-8d29-d5a712589e43","published":true,"quote":"A computer would deserve to be called intelligent if it could deceive a human into believing that it was human."}},"prev":{"path":"/thoughts-on-programming/f3572795-ffcb-434b-8ee3-715410f0c28a/","thought":{"author":"Holy Bible (Proverbs 27:1)","createdAt":"01 Jun 2020 00:00:00 UTC","description":["ðŸ’¡ There are a lot of reasons for doing #PairProgramming.
