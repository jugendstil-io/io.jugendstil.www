Why do so many start-ups fail?</strong>","An MVP is not just the final product with half the features in order to get it out the door just quicker. The MVP doesn't have to be a product at all, and it's not something you build only once, and then consider it done. It's instead an iterative process which allows you to identify your riskiest hypothesis, find the smallest possible experiment to test that hypothesis and leverage the results to correct the course of your journey.","Tackling problems that are interesting to solve rather than the ones which serve a market need is the number one reason for failure (noted in 42% of cases according to CB Insight failure post-mortem analysis)."],"id":"e619d417-48d7-41ae-973e-cac620ef8c58","published":true,"quote":"We must learn what customers really want, not what they say they want or what we think they should want."}},"prev":{"path":"/thoughts-on-programming/afba0c5e-02aa-40b0-b08a-0e0f70925a81/","thought":{"author":"Jon Postel","createdAt":"06 Aug 2020 00:00:00 UTC","description":["Today's #ThoughtsOnProgramming features US American computer scientist Jon Postel who is best known for his contributions as editor of the RFC document series and the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)."],"id":"afba0c5e-02aa-40b0-b08a-0e0f70925a81","published":true,"quote":"If we wish to count lines of code, we should not regard them as \"lines produced\" but as \"lines spent\"."}}}}}
